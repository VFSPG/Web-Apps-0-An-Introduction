<p>This set of courses and pages online is the fastest, easiest way for you to illustrate to us that you are ready to join our program and open the world of Programming for Game, Web and Mobile up to you.</p>

<h3>
<a id="program-goals" class="anchor" href="#program-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Program Goals</h3>

<p>Overall we want to create graduates who have all the skills to jum immediately into a career in programming with the skills that are immediately useful to any employer yet maintain an open pathway for higher education in Computer Science if that appeals to the student in the future.  That's what they pay me to say.</p>

<p>Really, we were just tired as industry guys of hiring people with all the right paper credentials only to find out what some simple tests or long interview process couldn't.   That it was going to take sometimes up to a year to teach a new programmer all the ins and outs, the trade secrets, tools and techniques to be effective low maintenance contributors in a game development team. So we started with the already highly successful VFS Game Design program, crammed in as much programming and computer science knowledge as we could, introduced 10 languages, client server technology, iOS and Android programming as we could.   We adding in a dash of reall world final projects (4 month commercial quality term project) 2D projects, Cloud programming, and any other current tech we had seen or our advisors told they wanted to see in the people they hired.   Then we stripped away every detail that was irrelevant.  We gave them the tools used in industry, taught them how to use them and then most importantly we infused an air of lateral thinking, problem solving and good old initiative.</p>

<p>Its an intense year, just like finalling a game.  At the end, we believe we produce the kind of people that you want to hire.   The kind that implement your vision.</p>

<a id="the-web-apps-series" class="anchor" href="#the-web-apps-series" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Web Apps Series</h3>

<p>This series is a subset of one of our first courses in the program.  We start the path by creating a hand crafted single page HTML5 App.   This document illustrates all the key elements of structure and programming required for basic client app development today.  The emphasis at first is on readability and maintainability.  We'll introduce concepts as we need them while we create a game.</p>

<p>Follow the course, do the lessons.   Pull down the sample code and work with it locally.  Fork the code and upload your version for our tools to evaluate.   If we think you have what it takes, we'll take the next step and if not we hope you learned something inthe process.   Programming isn't about languages and code, its about solving problems, enjoy. </p>
