That's what they pay me to say.\r\n\r\nReally, we were just tired as industry guys of hiring people with all the right paper credentials only to find out what some simple tests or long interview process couldn't.   That it was going to take sometimes up to a year to teach a new programmer all the ins and outs, the trade secrets, tools and techniques to be effective low maintenance contributors in a game development team. So we started with the already highly successful VFS Game Design program, crammed in as much programming and computer science knowledge as we could, introduced 10 languages, client server technology, iOS and Android programming as we could.   We adding in a dash of reall world final projects (4 month commercial quality term project) 2D projects, Cloud programming, and any other current tech we had seen or our advisors told they wanted to see in the people they hired.   Then we stripped away every detail that was irrelevant.  We gave them the tools used in industry, taught them how to use them and then most importantly we infused an air of lateral thinking, problem solving and good old initiative.\r\n\r\nIts an intense year, just like finalling a game.  At the end, we believe we produce the kind of people that you want to hire.   The kind that implement your vision.\r\n\r\n### The Web Apps Series\r\nThis series is a subset of one of our first courses in the program.  We start the path by creating a hand crafted single page HTML5 App.   This document illustrates all the key elements of structure and programming required for basic client app development today.  The emphasis at first is on readability and maintainability.  We'll introduce concepts as we need them while we create a game.\r\n\r\nFollow the course, do the lessons.   Pull down the sample code and work with it locally.  Fork the code and upload your version for our tools to evaluate.   If we think you have what it takes, we'll take the next step and if not we hope you learned something inthe process.   Programming isn't about languages and code, its about solving problems, enjoy. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nKey creator and contributor is our Sr. Instructor for Progamming, Scott Henshaw (@shenshawvfs). With contributions and inspiration from the many, many developers that went before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
